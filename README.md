# Adelia - php imageboard

Adelia is based on claire, tinyib and vichan. Time has took a toll on all of them. Modern code is about 1/100th of the code base of the older bloated php code. 

Each version will be extremely small codebase, have security measures implemented and be a great alternative to the older imageboards that are bloated and do not take advantage of latest versions of php.
