# Adelia - php imageboard


version 1 - very basic 

version 2 - improved security over version 1 

version 3 - implemented mysql, discontinued htmx and js 

version 4 - improved version of 3- this uses static files to reduce server load

version 5- far superior to all previous versions. run board.php to make the first post, it generates an index.html that board visitors land on. This is a serious start to a great app. 




Adelia is based on claire, tinyib and vichan. Time has took a toll on all of them. Modern code is about 1/100th of the code base of the older bloated php code. 

Each version will be extremely small codebase, have security measures implemented and be a great alternative to the older imageboards that are bloated and do not take advantage of latest versions of php. 

By nature php is not the most secure. I do NOT advocate running php for serious websites- use Rust or Go or something more modern. Php shines if you want a less serious and simple solution. In a way php is a mind virus in comparison to Rust with actix web or rocket- , Rust objectively makes incredibly superior web apps.
