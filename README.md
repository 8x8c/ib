# Adelia - php imageboard


version 1 - very basic 
version 2 - improved security over version 1 
version 3 - implemented mysql, discontinued htmx and js 








Adelia is based on claire, tinyib and vichan. Time has took a toll on all of them. Modern code is about 1/100th of the code base of the older bloated php code. 

Each version will be extremely small codebase, have security measures implemented and be a great alternative to the older imageboards that are bloated and do not take advantage of latest versions of php. 

By nature php is not the most secure. I do NOT advocate running php for serious websites- use Rust or Go or something more modern. Php shines if you want a less serious and simple solution. In a way php is a mind virus in comparison to Rust with actix web or rocket- , Rust objectively makes incredibly superior web apps.
